PDF Translator in Python
This is a Python-based PDF Translator that allows you to translate text from one language to another in PDF documents.

Features
Extracts text from PDF files.
Translates the extracted text to any desired language.
Supports multiple languages for translation.
Requirements
To use this project, you'll need to install the following Python packages:

PyPDF2: For reading PDF files.
googletrans: For language translation (Google Translate API).
tkinter: For creating a simple GUI (optional, if you include it).
pytesseract: If you need to handle image-based PDFs.
To install these dependencies, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install PyPDF2 googletrans tkinter pytesseract
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pdf-translator.git
Install the required dependencies (as mentioned above).

Run the script to start the PDF translation:

bash
Copy
Edit
python pdf_translator.py
How to Use
Provide the input PDF file by either selecting it through a file dialog (if GUI is implemented) or specifying the file path in the script.
Select the target language for translation (e.g., Spanish, French, etc.).
The script will process the PDF, extract the text, translate it, and save the translated text in a new PDF or as a plain text file.
Example Usage
bash
Copy
Edit
python pdf_translator.py --input_file "document.pdf" --output_file "translated_document.pdf" --target_language "es"
--input_file: Path to the PDF file you want to translate.
--output_file: Name of the output translated PDF or text file.
--target_language: Language code for translation (e.g., "es" for Spanish, "fr" for French).
Notes
The translation uses the Google Translate API, which requires an internet connection.
Some complex PDFs (such as those with a lot of images) might require additional tools like pytesseract for OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
